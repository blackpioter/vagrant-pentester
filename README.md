The Vagrant Pentester
==========================================================================================
<p>
A Vagrant based turn-key vulnerable web application suite for pentesters in-training. No configuration 
necessary, simply install and attack.
</p>

<p>
This is stage 1 & 2 of my Automated Interrogation project. It leverages Vagrant to install an Ubuntu LTS 12.04 base box running
in VirtualBox. The Vagrantfile provided in this repository configures the virtual machine and executes Puppet provisioners 
that install and configure essential services such as Apache, PHP, MySQL, Java etc. and a Shell provisioner that installs and
configures the vulnerable web applications. <br>
There are now two methods for installation, either downloading the complete Vagrant Pentester Base Box (preferred) or 
cloning the repository and letting the Vagrantfile run the scripts against the hashicorp/precise32 Base Box. 
</p>

<p>
*** These applications should only be run in a localhost environment preferably using a Host-only network adapter. 
</p>

<p>
It is assumed that VirtualBox and Git are installed and that you know how to use them. 
A minimum of Vagrant 1.5.2 is required. If you have an older version of Vagrant that was installed as a Ruby gem you 
need to remove it before installing. If you use RVM you may notice issues when executing Vagrant commands. Removing RVM path
variables from your bash profiles (~/.bashrc, ~/.profile, ~/.bash_profile) should correct this. 
</p>


### Install Vagrant
https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads<br>


Verify that Vagrant is installed and working by typing in the terminal: <br>
`vagrant -v`

will print out the Vagrant version number<br>


### Download the Vagrant Pentester Base Box
https://github.com/blackpioter/vagrant-pentester<br>

When the script returns back to the terminal you will notice that a 'vagrant-pentester_default' machine is
running in VirtualBox. By default it will start up headless. You can choose to SSH into the box or close it and reopen
the box as you normally would with a GUI.

### Common Vagrant Commands
- `vagrant up`          -- starts vagrant environment (also provisions only on the FIRST vagrant up)
- `vagrant status`      -- outputs status of the vagrant machine
- `vagrant halt`        -- stops the vagrant machine
- `vagrant reload`      -- restarts vagrant machine, loads new Vagrantfile configuration
- `vagrant provision`   -- forces reprovisioning of the vagrant machine
- `vagrant ssh`         -- connects to machine via SSH
- `vagrant destroy`     -- stops and deletes all traces of the vagrant machine
